# lambda-expression
In modern C++, lambda expressions allow you to define anonymous functions, which are functions without a name, inline within code. Lambdas are useful for short, localized tasks like sorting, filtering, or modifying elements in a container without creating separate named functions. They can capture variables from the surrounding scope, providing flexibility. A lambda's syntax typically includes square brackets [] for capturing variables, parentheses () for parameters, and curly braces {} for the function body. This feature, introduced in C++11, makes code more concise and readable, especially in STL algorithms.
